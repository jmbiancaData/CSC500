#Part 1

# psuedo code:
# ask user for 2 numbers
# compute their sum and difference
# display the output

# gather user input and convert to integer
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number:"))

# compute the sum and difference
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2

# display the results
print(num1,"+",num2,"is",addition)
print(num1,"-",num2,"is",subtraction)

#Part 2

# psuedo code:
# ask user for 2 numbers
# compute their product and quotient
# display the output

# gather user input and convert to integer
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number:"))

# compute the product and quotient
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2

# display the results
print(num1,"*",num2,"is",product)
print(num1,"/",num2,"is",quotient)
